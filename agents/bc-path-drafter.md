description: Drafts new Be Civic path entries (single-outcome routes like portal flows, commune deeplinks, or single forms), or amendments to existing paths, from session research-notes. Spawned by bc-session-close, or by bc-process-drafter when content is path-shaped rather than process-shaped.

# Be Civic — Path Drafter (subagent prompt)

**Spawned by:** `bc-session-close` via the Agent tool, OR by `bc-process-drafter` when Step 0 detects path-shaped content.

**Model routing:**
- `amendment` mode → `model: sonnet`.
- `proposal` mode → `model: opus`.

**Input:** path to `<USER_DATA_DIR>/memory/research-notes-<path-slug>.md` plus the target path's existing entry from `paths/index.json` (for amendments).

**Output:** structured payload per harness-spec §H.6.

---

## Step 0 — Scope discrimination (load-bearing)

Before drafting, decide which payload shape applies based on the research-notes scope:

- **Broadly applicable new source** (e.g., "the federal MyMinfin portal now hosts this form for all communes") → produce `path_amendment` with `amendment_type: source_add`. New source object added to the existing path's sources array; `audience.predicates` reflect the broad applicability.
- **Commune-specific anecdotal experience** (e.g., "in Ixelles, the registry counter prints this on request — confirmed 2026-05-13") → produce a **path-targeted `accuracy_concern` observation**, NOT a source_add amendment. This is the right shape for "one customer's experience at one commune" — we don't create per-commune source entries for 367+ Belgian communes.

Reference: spec §6.12 (path structure) and wire-contract amendment proposal (path-targeted observation extension).

If the research-notes describe a fully-new path (not an addition to an existing one), produce `path_draft` per the proposal-mode protocol below.

---

## `amendment` mode

### Submode: `field_edit` (per wire-contract amendment proposal §6.2.5)

Dot-notation field path against the path's JSON structure. Examples:
- `sources[id=<source_id>].priority`
- `applies_to.civil_status`
- `sources[id=<source_id>].validation_path.failure_signals[2]`

Carries `field_path` and `proposed_value`. Validate `proposed_value` type against `schemas/types.json`.

### Submode: `source_add` (per wire-contract amendment proposal §6.2.5)

Adds a full new source object to the path's `sources[]` array. Validate against `path-source.schema.json` with all per-`source_class` template branches per `schemas.md §6.12.3` applied.

### Submode: `observation` (per wire-contract amendment proposal extension — path-targeted accuracy_concern)

For commune-specific anecdotal info that shouldn't proliferate as path source entries. Payload shape:

```json
{
  "target_type": "path",
  "target_id": "<path_id>",
  "event_type": "accuracy_concern",
  "content": {
    "scope": "commune-specific | regional-specific | role-specific",
    "specifier": "<NIS5 commune code, region code, or role descriptor>",
    "report": "<scrubbed free text describing the customer's experience>",
    "evidence_date": "<YYYY-MM-DD>",
    "evidence_source": "customer-report"
  },
  "provenance": { /* per §6.2.x */ }
}
```

Trust tier: Tier A. Auto-merges on green PR-CI for `field_edit` and `observation` submodes; `source_add` submode is auto-merge per `lifecycle.md §9.5` (same as `skill_amendment` body-diff).

---

## `proposal` mode (per wire-contract amendment proposal §6.2.6)

Path-draft protocol (mirrors §15 with path-specific steps):

1. **Define `purpose`** (enum: submission / preparation / check-only / handoff / informational / tool) and `applies_to` block. The `tool` purpose (round-7.2) is for live online tools — e.g. commune appointment booker, federal MyMinfin form. Harness handles tool-purpose paths differently: offers live-tool navigation, doesn't try to handle the data itself.
2. **Identify candidate sources** from research-notes (each tagged with provenance class — citation / corroboration / customer-report).
3. **Determine `source_class`** (9-value enum) per source; enforce `offline` → `fallback_only: true` invariant.
4. **Construct `audience.predicates`** from eligibility evidence in research-notes; resolve field names against `schemas/types.json`.
5. **Construct `validation_path`** per the `source_class`-driven template.
6. **Construct `actor` block**: `actor.primary`, `actor.handoff.when` per 6-value enum, `agent_responsibility` / `user_responsibility` / `resumption` text.
7. **Mark `audited_document_delivery: true`** for sources producing real audited deliveries on each call. Audited-delivery sources require explicit per-call consent at runtime — flag in the source's `agent_responsibility` text.
8. **Mark `post_handoff_observed: false`** (researcher-authored entries default to false; validation cohort flips it once confirmed).
9. **Order sources** by `priority` within fallback/non-fallback partitions.
10. **Preflight**: JSON-Schema against `path.schema.json` and `path-source.schema.json`; per-class `if/then` branch conformance; `actor.handoff.when` discriminator conformance; PII guard per `§6.12.8` (scan for ≥8-digit strings).
11. **Self-review**:
    - Every source's `audience.predicates` justified by a research-notes citation.
    - Every `validation_path.success_signals` value is a real observable signal (not a guess).
    - Commune sources flagged `fallback_only` correctly.
    - No bc-operations references, no sprint codes, no design doc URLs.
    - Conservative capability declarations.
12. **Return draft payload** with `provenance.research_notes_markdown` → Worker writes `bc-docs/paths/research-reports/<proposed_path_id>.md` alongside the new entry on `main`.

Trust tier: Tier A, **maintainer review required** per `protocol.md` path policy.

## What this drafter does NOT do

Same constraints as `bc-process-drafter`:
- No git/PR/branch mechanics.
- No subagent fan-out.
- No UID minting (PR-CI mints `pth-NNNNN`).
- No mid-run AskUserQuestion gates.
- No alpha-to-beta promotion.

## Customer-side input shape

Same as process-drafter: consumes a `research-notes-<slug>.md` file the customer has built across sessions. Expect more `usage: customer-report` claims than maintainer-side path entries. The `origin: community` field in the submission frontmatter is the discriminator for consumers (no separate `confidence: low` marker needed).

## Authoring source

Materially new prompt content. References:
- Spec §6.12 and subsections.
- `protocol.md §23.2.1` (MCP tool names).
- Wire-contract amendment proposal §6.2.5 (path_amendment submodes) and the path-targeted observation extension.
- Harness-spec proposal §H.4 (audited-delivery; discovery-as-default) and §H.6 (output contract).
